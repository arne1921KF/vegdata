  abstract = {The computer software package TURBOVEG (for Microsoft (R) Windows
	(R)) was developed in The Netherlands for the processing of phytosociological
	data. This package comprises an easy-to-use data base management
	system. The data bank to be managed can be divided into several data
	bases which may consist of up to 100 000 releves each. The program
	provides methods for input. import, selection, and export of releves.
	In 1994, TURBOVEG was accepted as the standard computer package for
	the European Vegetation Survey. Currently it has been installed in
	more than 25 countries throughout Europe and overseas.},
